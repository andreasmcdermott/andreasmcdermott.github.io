<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>
  My name is Andreas McDermott. I live in Lund, a small town in southern Sweden with my wife and soon-to-be-born son. 
  I'm currently working as a consultant at <a href="http://www.cgi.com" target="_blank">CGI</a>. My main area is web development with .Net.
  Before this I worked for <a href="http://www.truevisionsys.com" target="_blank">TrueVision Systems</a> in California which is a small company 
  that makes advanced visualization systems for micro surgery.
</p>
<p>
  I have been programming for the last 13 years. 
  I got into programming to make games, 
  which I still enjoy doing in my spare times when I have the time (I try to participate in 
  <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo" target="_blank">Ludum Dare</a> 
  as often as possible). I prefer to work in C#, JavaScript (as long as I can use jQuery) or Lua these days, 
  but am also profficiant in C/C++, Java and PHP. Next on my list of languages to have a look at is Ruby!
</p>
<p>
  When not in front of a computer I enjoy hiking, photography and many other outdoor activities.
