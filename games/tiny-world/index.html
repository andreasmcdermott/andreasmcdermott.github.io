<p>
  This game was developed during 48 hours for the 23rd Ludum Dare game competition.
            It is a shooter where the player has to switch between controlling a 
            tower and a hot air balloon to protect the tiny city being pulled by the turtle.

            This was my first entry in Ludum Dare since my university days and I'm overall happy with my entry. 
            It was my first time using Lua and Löve2D and I really enjoyed working with both the engine and the language.
            I also chose to use a component based game design instead of the more traditional structure using inheritance. 
            This means that instead of creating game objects as hierarchical structures like:<br />
            "Entity -> Enemy -> Zombie" (where the arrows symbolize inheritance) the game objects are composed of smaller
            components that together define the final entity. Examples of components that I used in the game are:
            <ul>
              <li>Draw: An entity with this component will be drawn every frame.</li>
              <li>Sound: An entity with this component will play a sound.</li>
              <li>Position: An entity with this component will have a position on the screen.</li>
              <li>Move: An entity with this component will move according to a specified vector every frame.</li>
            </ul>
            I was very happy with the ease I was able to add new types of game objects by combining existing components.

            All code and content is created by me using the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Engine: <a href="https://love2d.org/">Löve2D</a></li>
              <li>Code: Lua, written in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a></li>
