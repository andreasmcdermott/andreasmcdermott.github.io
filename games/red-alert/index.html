<p>
  This game was developed during 48 hours for the 27th Ludum Dare game competition (the theme was "10 seconds").
  It is a top-down shooter where the player has to survive 10-second rounds against zombies and
  moving walls, while collecting as many coins as possible.

  I had some issues getting started with this entry. My initial idea was to have walls moving every 10 seconds, 
  but it wasn't very fun to play. Instead I made the walls move more often and have the zombies spawn every 10 seconds.
  It is quite fun, but maybe a bit limtied.
