<p>
            This game was developed during 48 hours for the 26th Ludum Dare game competition.
            It is a platformer where the player has to get through five levels filled with obstacles like 
            lasers, mines and evil robots. The player is equipped with a jetpack and a laser gun.

            I'm overall happy with my entry. This was my first try at making a game
            in GameMaker (which is part of the reason why I choose something safe, like a platformer) and I'm impressed
            at the speed it allowed me to get from nothing to the final version of the game.
