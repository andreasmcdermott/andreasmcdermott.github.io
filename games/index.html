        This game was developed during 48 hours for the 26th Ludum Dare game competition.
        It is a platformer where the player has to get through five levels filled with obstacles like 
        lasers, mines and evil robots. The player is equipped with a jetpack and a laser gun.

        I'm overall happy with my entry. This was my first try at making a game
        in GameMaker (which is part of the reason why I choose something safe, like a platformer) and I'm impressed
        at the speed it allowed me to get from nothing to the final version of the game.

        This game was developed during 48 hours for the 23rd Ludum Dare game competition.
        It is a shooter where the player has to switch between controlling a 
        tower and a hot air balloon to protect the tiny city being pulled by the turtle.

        This was my first entry in Ludum Dare since my university days and I'm overall happy with my entry. 
        It was my first time using Lua and Löve2D and I really enjoyed working with both the engine and the language.
        I also chose to use a component based game design instead of the more traditional structure using inheritance. 
        This means that instead of creating game objects as hierarchical structures like:<br />
        "Entity -> Enemy -> Zombie" (where the arrows symbolize inheritance) the game objects are composed of smaller
        components that together define the final entity. Examples of components that I used in the game are:
        <ul>
          <li>Draw: An entity with this component will be drawn every frame.</li>
          <li>Sound: An entity with this component will play a sound.</li>
          <li>Position: An entity with this component will have a position on the screen.</li>
          <li>Move: An entity with this component will move according to a specified vector every frame.</li>
        </ul>
        I was very happy with the ease I was able to add new types of game objects by combining existing components.
