It's been quite here for a few month now. First came summer and with it less computer time. 
Then came my son (six weeks early) and with him even less computer time.

But I've been slowly getting back to getting some work done on my projects. This weekend I will try to create a complete game for [Ludum Dare #27](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo).
For those of you that don't know, Ludum Dare is a game competition where one creates a complete computer game from scratch in 48 hours. This will
be my fourth entry ([my last two entries can be found here](http://www.andreasmcdermott.com/games))).

I will be using pretty much the same tools as last time:
- [GameMaker Studio](http://www.yoyogames.com/) (it allows me to create something reeeally quickly which I'm gonna need. A three week old baby doesn't allow for a lot of spare time).
- [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/), GameMaker Studio's built in editor, [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) or [Pyxel Edit](http://pyxeledit.com/) for graphics (depending on ambition and last minute decisions)
- [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) for sounds effects
- [iNudge](http://www.inudge.net/), [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) and/or [PixiTracker](http://www.warmplace.ru/soft/pixitracker/) for music.

I'll post some progress reports during the weekend. Wish me luck!
