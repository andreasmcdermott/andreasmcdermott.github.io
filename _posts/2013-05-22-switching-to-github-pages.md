Switching to GitHub pages
=========================
This is pretty cool indeed! My website is now up and running on GitHub pages. I'm very exiceted about this. 
My first impressions are that it is very easy to get started with and use. It also has exactly what I need (and nothing I don't need). 

*AND*(!) it is completely free. Pretty cool indeed.

Why I'm getting a blog
----------------------
So as you might notice this is the first post in my blog. This is because I didn't have a blog previously. 
I plan on getting my hands dirty with some new techniques and thought that it could be fun and valuable to share my progress and experience (both for others'
and for my own sake).

I'll post some more about this in the next entry.
