This is pretty cool indeed! My website is now up and running on GitHub pages.
My first impressions are that it is very easy to get started with and use. It also has exactly the features I need:
- Simple editing of posts and pages (html and markdown)
- Easy administration of website (git and notepad++)
- Source control (GitHub, obviously)

*AND* it is completely free. Pretty cool!

-------------------------------------------

I will keep working on the site for the next couple of weeks (free time is a shortage these days), 
making changes to the design, learning more markdown (which I haven't used before), etc.

As soon as the site is done (or close enough) I will start my next learning project which I'm looking forward to.
So many new techniques and so little time..
