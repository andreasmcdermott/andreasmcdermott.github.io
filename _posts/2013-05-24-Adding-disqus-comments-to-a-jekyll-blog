Because Jekyll serves static html-pages I have to use a commenting system that stores all the data for me.
I only knew of [Disqus][1], so made some research to see what else was out there. 
I found a good article comparing the top three Google results when searching for "comments system":

* [Disqus][1]
* [LiveFyre][2]
* [IntenseDebate][3]

I decided on using Disqus.

How to get Disqus working with Jekyll?
--------------------------------------
It is very easy actually! I've outlined the steps I took below.

###Step 1: Sign up for an account
Start with heading to Disqus' [website][1] and sign up for an account (assuming you don't already have one).

###Step 2:
