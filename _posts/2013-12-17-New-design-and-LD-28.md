It's been a while (again) since my last update. Partly this is because I've been playing a bit with Ruby and Rails. I had plans of replacing my Github Pages-hosted site and make something in Rails instead, but finally decided to stick with this one. Instead I've created a new design (comments are welcome!) that I've worked on for a bit of time. I'll update the game pages in the next few days and then it should be done!

Last weekend was Ludum Dare 28. I had every intention of finishing a game using Haxe and OpenFL but life got in the way so I never finished my entry.
