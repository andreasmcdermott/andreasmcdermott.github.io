I will be starting a new project in the next few days. I've been wanting a project that allows me to learn more about RavenDB.
I have tried it a little and really enjoy working with it, but would like a more serious project to actually learn the more advanced stuff.

My requirements for the project:
* Use MVC .Net
* Use RavenDB
* Something I can use
* Something others can use (hopefully at least)

I have my own consulting business where I do a bit of web development for small business. Up until now I have been keeping track of hours and tasks
in a Google Docs spreadsheet but want to switch to a project management tool. I have found a lot to choose from, but none that fit my requirements (cheap and easy to work with).
So, I've decided that my project will be a project management tool. I will start simple with the main features I need from a tool like this which means:

* Add clients, projects and tasks
* Track hours (estimated, actual and difference)
* Create invoices automatically
* Runs in browser

Because I have no co-workers, collaboration features are not high on my list, but I do hope to be able to add that as well in the future. 
Other feature I would like to add at some point are: calendar, files, responsive design (mobile and tablet), and more.

##Blog updates
I usually enjoy step-by-step series (like [Rob Ashton's Raven Image Gallery](http://codeofrob.com/entries/ravendb---image-gallery-project-i.html)).
Because of this I will try to keep my blog updated regularly so that others might be able to benefit from my experiences.

##Demo
Once I have something to show it will be available at [http://m1pm.apphb.com](http://m1pm.apphb.com).
