I found a new cool tool that will make it even easier to manage my blog/site.

My site is hosted on Github Pages and the blog posts are written in Markdown. Usually this means that to write a new post I open up Notepad++, write the post, and then push it to my Github repository. This works pretty well, but it is not as easy (especially when I don't have access to my own computer) as writing a blog post in Wordpress for example.

In the past it has happened that I've used Github's online editor to correct mistakes in a post or to create a new post. Now I have found a better way! [Prose](http://prose.io) is an online content management tool with nice features for Jekyll blogs, like template when creating a new post and a toolbar (perfect for someone like me who doesn't write enough Markdown to remember all the details). And it is very easy to get started: just sign in with your Github account and all your repositories![](/_posts/Capture.PNG) are right there. 

I haven't used it much yet, but so far I can defintely recommend it!
